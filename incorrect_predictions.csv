"However, a dozen climate, health and theological experts skeptical of dangerous manmade climate change allegations hosted a press event the day before the workshop. Three of them managed to get into the Vatican event. But when Climate Depot director Marc Morano tried to ask the UN Secretary General to advise Pope Francis that many Catholics and other Christians believe the papal position on global warming is ill-advised, a security guard took Moranos microphone away and told him, control yourself, or you will be escorted out of here. Apostates have no rights at climate confabs, Vatican or otherwise.",5_2,0_0
"People phoned at home are easy prey to cultural intimidation. The immediate thought is likely to be that the pollster has your number and, who knows, might even call your boss if you say the ""wrong"" thing. (Pollsters assure us that they do not know the identities of those phoned, but of course when you are dragged away from dinner by a caller from the New York Times you don't think about that.) As a result of this intimidationsuddenly someone wants to know what you think of global emissions and greenhouse gasespeople are alert for cues as to the ""right"" answer and are only too happy to provide it.",5_2,0_0

"The solar industry is jubilant over President Obama's Clean Power Plan, released in its final form on Monday, August 3. The same day, however, some other news reminded the public of what happens when government policy mandates and incentivizes a favored energy source: Taxpayer dollars are gobbled up and investors lose out.",4_1,0_0
"Since Obama took office, the US has averaged 0.6 hurricane landfalls per year. This is the fewest hurricanes of any president since at least 1850. By contrast, Grover Clevelands presidency averaged more than five times as many hurricanes per year as Obamas.",0_0,1_7
"Efforts to control Leviathan have evolved slowly throughout our history. As the disciplining effects of controls in the tax and spending area have improved, there has been a natural tendency by regulators to select the least disciplined instrument of regulation. For that reason, regulations have become the preferred tool of special interests and those who believe the public interest is best advanced by expanding political interference in the economy. It is time to begin to subject regulations to the same type of controls to which expenditures have long been exposed. That does not mean that OIRA should presume to ""know"" what regulations are best, but, rather, that OIRA should ensure that the information provided on the costs of regulation (and benefits to the extent these continue to be requested) are reasonably honest and defensible. That goal is ambiguous enoughOIRA should reject all speculative arguments (the various gimmicks discussed in the latter part of the report) based on theoretical deviations from a ""perfect market."" OIRA should examine whether an agency has considered the possibility that existing regulations might have created the problems that the new regulation supposedly ""solves"" and instead call for reducing the scope and scale of government interference in the economy.",4_1,0_0
